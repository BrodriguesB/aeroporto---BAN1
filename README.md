# Aeroporto
Just a simple project using postgreSQL, node, and angular.
To run you need to have node installed and a database called **aeroporto**.

Clone this repo go to the root folder and call the following:
 - `npm install` to install node dependencies **YOU NEED THE LATEST VERSION OF NODE AND NPM**
 - `bower install` to install bower dependencies (bower installed on last command)
 - `node models/database.js` to set the tables models

If everything is ok you can call **`npm start`** to start the sever, and accessing http://localhost:3000 should give you a site.
