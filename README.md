# Aeroporto
Just a simple project using postgreSQL, node, and angular.
To run you need to have node installed, a database called <strong>aeroporto</strong>.
<br>
Clone this repo, and set the tables models with `node models/database.js` on project root folder 
<br>
If everything is ok you can call `npm install` to start the sever, and accessing <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> should give you a site.
